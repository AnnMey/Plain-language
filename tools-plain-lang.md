## Introduction
The aim of this report is to compare the product documentation for three project management tools:  

* **Jira** and **Confluence** by Atlassian, and  
* **Flare** by MadCap  

with regard to the advantages and disadvandages.  

## Jira and Confluence user guides
Both **Jira** and **Confluence** were developed by Atlassian Corporation. Jira is a tool for software development and project management. Confluence is a tool for konwledge management and project collaboration.  

The **Official User Guides** that describe [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/guides) and [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/guides) have a similar structure and include the following tabs:  
* *Features*
* *Product guide*
* *Pricing*
* *Enterprise*

Confluence has an additional *Templates* tab, which lists available templates. The templates are divided into categories.

### **Disadvantages**
The *Get started* section contains a lot of information. For this reason, you can find it difficult to follow.

## Flare overview
**MadCap Flare** is a tool for single-source publishing developed by MadCap Software.  

In the product page there is:  
* a 30-day trial, and 
* an [Overview](https://www.madcapsoftware.com/products/flare/#content) of the tool.

### **Advantages**
At the beginning of the *Overview* section, there are links to subsections dedicated to different functions of Flare.

Next, there is a flowchart depicting possible file formats and the order of processes in which you can realise the functions.

The whole product *Overview* is available in a single-flow description, which provides a complete insight into the features of the tool.

### **Disadvantages**
* The order of the general menu tabs is not clear:

The *Why Flare?* could be placed between the *Overview* and *Whatâ€™s New* tabs.  

* The *Overview* section on MadCap Flare is 3,500 words long. This is around 14 standard pages of text.

* There are client testimonials between the *Overview* menu with links to subsections and the description of the first function. This makes the *Overview* section longer and less coherent.  

* There is too much visual material.

## Conclusion

The tools described in this report are complex and versatile. Their documentation reflects this compexity. It seems complicated, but it has both advantages and disadvantages.

| Tool              | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|-------------------|------------|---------------|
