## Introduction
The aim of this report is to compare the product documentation for three project management tools:  

* **Jira** and **Confluence** by Atlassian, and  
* **Flare** by MadCap  

with regard to the advantages and disadvandages.  

## Jira and Confluence user guides
Both **Jira** and **Confluence** were developed by Atlassian Corporation. Jira is a tool for software development and project management. Confluence is a tool for konwledge management and project collaboration.  

The **Official User Guides** that describe [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/guides) and [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/guides) have a similar structure and include the following tabs:  
* *Features*
* *Product guide*
* *Pricing*
* *Enterprise*

Confluence has an additional *Templates* tab, which lists available templates. The templates are divided into categories.

### **Advantages**
The basic product information is clear and well-structured. Features are described in a concise way, there is one sentence for each feature.  
The Product guide includes: 
* a brief overview of the tool, 
* a quick start guide, 
* best practices, 
* demo versions, 
* tutorials, and 
* video tutorials.

### **Disadvantages**
The “Get started” contains a lot of information. For this reason, you may find it difficult to follow.

## Flare overview
**MadCap Flare** is a tool for single-source publishing developed by MadCap Software.  

In the product page there is:  
* a 30-day trial, and 
* an [Overview](https://www.madcapsoftware.com/products/flare/#content) of the tool.

### **Advantages**
At the beginning of the Overview section, there are links to subsections dedicated to different functions of Flare.

This menu is followed by a flowchart depicting possible file formats and the order of processes in twich the functions can be realised.

The whole product Overview is available in a single-flow description, which provides a complete insight into the tool’s features.

### **Disadvantages**
For whatever reason, the order of the general menu tabs seems a bit random:

The *Why Flare?* tab would make more sense between the *Overview* and *What’s New* tabs.  

The Overview section on MadCap Flare is 3,500 words long, which is around 14 standard pages of text. Quite a handful.  

Between the Overview menu with link to subsections and the description of the first function, there is a 5-line client testimonial with a link to more testimonials, followed by two colourful self-promotion blocks with links. It makes the whole Overview section longer and less coherent.  

In general, there is too much visual material, like icons and screenshots. They create a slightly chaotic impression.  

## Conclusion
The tools described in this report constitute complex and versatile software. Having this in mind, the provided documentation is as clear, concise and user-friendly as it gets.

But jokes aside, both formats of information presentation have their pros and cons. The nature of Jira, Confluence and Flare software – being umbrella applications covering numerous features and functions – makes them difficult to describe in a way that is both comprehensive and concise.  

Although the provided user guides and overviews may seem too extensive and user-unfriendly, most of the information provided is not redundant.
